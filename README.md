# CHAIN GREP

**Chain Grep** is a Visual Studio Code extension that lets you build and execute a sequence of chained text or regex searches on any source file. You can progressively refine your search results, refresh them when the file changes, and highlight text or other snippets. This makes it perfect for searching logs, debugging output, or any other text files. The extension also provides a simple popup that accepts your query along with toggle options for "Invert" and "Case Sensitive." In addition, you can quickly grep selected text using a custom keybinding.

## Key Features

-   **Chained Searches**: Combine multiple searches (text or regex) in a chain, each refining the results of the previous step.
-   **Custom Popup**: A minimal QuickPick-based interface for entering your query and toggling "Invert" or "Case Sensitive".
-   **Selection Shortcut**: Press `CTRL+ALT+G` (or your custom keybinding) to grep any currently selected text.
-   **Results in a New Document**: Each chainâ€™s results appear in an unsaved document, displaying both a summary and a detailed log.
-   **Highlighting**: Toggle highlights for any string or special character, with persistent highlights across file switches.
-   **Automatic Re-Highlighting**: Whenever you return to a file, any highlights you had before are restored.
-   **Easy Refresh**: The "Chain Grep: Refresh" command reverts the source file from disk (pulling in external changes, if any) and reapplies the entire chain.

## Installation Options

### 1. Extensions Marketplace

1. Search for "chain-grep" in the Extensions panel.
2. Click **Install**.

### 2. Using a Built Package

1. Download the `.vsix` file from the Releases tab.
2. In VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
3. Run **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** and select the `.vsix` file.
4. Reload or restart VS Code if needed.

### 3. Build from Source

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chain-grep.git
    cd chain-grep
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Compile:
    ```bash
    npm run compile
    ```
4. Package (optional):
    ```bash
    npm install -g vsce
    vsce package
    ```
    This creates a `.vsix` you can install in VS Code.

## Usage

### Commands

-   **Chain Grep: Find Text**: Opens the popup for a plain-text query.
-   **Chain Grep: Find Regex**: Opens the popup for a regex query.
-   **Chain Grep: Grep Selection**: Prefills the popup with your selection and executes a text search.
-   **Chain Grep: Refresh**: Re-runs the search chain on the updated source file.
-   **Chain Grep: Toggle Highlight**: Toggles highlighting for the selection or word under the cursor.
-   **Chain Grep: Clear Highlights**: Removes all highlights.

### Typical Workflow

1. Open a file in VS Code.
2. Use a Chain Grep command (e.g., "Find Text") to open the QuickPick.
3. Enter your query and set toggles.
4. A new unsaved document displays the results.
5. If the source file changes, use **Chain Grep: Refresh**.
6. Use **Toggle Highlight** to mark strings. Return to the file anytime, and highlights remain.

## Keybindings

The extension provides default keybindings. Make sure they are not overridden by other user or system keybindings. If they are, you can edit them manually in your keybindings configuration:

```jsonc
{
    "command": "chainGrep.grepSelection",
    "key": "ctrl+alt+g",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
},
{
    "command": "chainGrep.toggleHighlight",
    "key": "ctrl+alt+m",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
}
```
